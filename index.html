   <p> Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate seasons, succeeding winter and preceding summer.
    When it is spring in the Northern Hemisphere, it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa.
     <br>at the spring (or vernal) equinox, days and nights are approximately twelve hours long, with daytime 
     length increasing and nighttime length decreasing as the season progresses.
      <br> 
Spring and "springtime" refer to the season, and also to ideas of rebirth, rejuvenation, renewal, resurrection and regrowth. 
Subtropical and tropical areas have climates better described in terms of other seasons, e.g. dry or wet, monsoonal or cyclonic.
 Cultures may have local names for seasons which have little equivalence to the terms originating in Europe

<p> Easter is the most important religious feast in the Christian liturgical year.
   Christians believe that Jesus was resurrected from the dead on the "third day"
    (two days after his crucifixion), and celebrate this resurrection on Easter Day,
     two days after Good Friday. The date of Easter varies between 22 March and 25 April
     (which corresponds to between 4 April and 8 May in the Gregorian Calendar for the Eastern and Oriental
     Orthodox Churches using the Julian Calendar). In the Southern Hemisphere Easter occurs during autumn. 
     In this celebration, the children do an easter egg hunt.</p>
